# UIASReader

This program is for reading the UIAS ((Unique Identifier Audit System) files provided by the New York State Education Department via the IRS Portal.
It currently only handles the Simultaneous Enrollments and False Transfers files.
The files are provided by NYSED in .xls format, but must be saved as .xlsx format before UIAS reader can use them.

##Future planned functionality:

1. Disappearing students files
1. False Dropout files
1. Comparison to prior month
1. Graphic user interface using Shiny
